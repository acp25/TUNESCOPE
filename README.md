## User Story

As a user, I want an application that allows me to explore my favorite albums, discover new ones, leave comments / likes, and add to a playlist.
When I open the application, I am greeted with a login form, explore button, and a learn more button. 
When I click on the learn more button, I am taken to a page that explains what TuneScope is to the user.
When I click explore, I am taken to the page with all the albums listed. 
When I login / signup, I am taken to the explore page where I can view all the albums in their perspective genre. 
When I click on a cover art, I am given the tracks on the album, the likes / comments on the album, the ability to like / leave a comment, and the ability to add the album to my playlist.
